/* 9. Sorting a list

Write an algorithm that will sort a given linked list. For example given a list such as 3->2->5->7->1, 

your program will output the sorted version of this list which will be 1->2->3->5->7. 

You may not use another list or any other data structure such as an array to store the data.
