Create a GitHub repo called "DSA-LinkedList". Save all this work in the repo and submit the repo via the submission box at the end of this checkpoint.

In these drills, you'll practice creating a linked list, implementing its core, and some supplemental operations. 

You will also use your linked list to solve interview questions. Don't forget to assess the big O for each of these exercises. 

Start each problem by stating 1 or more sample inputs and outputs.
